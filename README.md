2. The number of times the tweets were retweeted during the selected day.
3. The number of times a Tweet was hit like during the selected day.
4. The number of posts on the topic: the number of tweets and retweets during the selected day.
5. Number of Interactors: The total number of interactions with the topic during the day, including retweets, retweets, and likes.
6. Statistics of tweets according to the selected day.
7. The highest period in which the topic is published and interacted with during the day.
8. The least period during which the topic is published and interacted with during the day.
